Python scripts for automatic key detection in EDM
==================================================

This repository provides scripts for key detection and its evaluation. 
It also contains a program to automatically extract key-profiles from a corpus.

"key_detector.py" estimates the key of the songs contained in a folder,
and performs an evaluation of its results according to the MIREX standard.
It generate text files with the key estimations for further evaluation
as well as a summary with the parameters used and confusion matrixes as 
cvs files.

There are two modes of operation: 'txt' and 'title'.

In 'txt mode, the program expects a first argument indicating the route
to a folder containing the audio to be analysed, and a second argument
containing the route to the ground truth annotation as individual text
files. The program expects that the file names of both the audio and the
annotations are equal (except for the extension), and if the name do not 
match it will skip the evaluation for that file.

In 'title' mode, the program looks for the ground-truth annotation embedded
in the name of the audio file itself, according to the following format:

FORMAT:  'Artist Name - Title of the Song = Key annotation < genre > DATASET.wav'
EXAMPLE: 'Audio Junkies - Bird On A Wire = F minor < edm > KF1000.wav'

Besides common python libraries, this script depends on a module named
"key_tools.py" which is provided along this file.
